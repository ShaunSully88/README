## Project Description
This project is a professional README.md generator that is created via command line application. 

## Installation Instructions
Not applicable for this project

## Usage
The User is prompted with questions following running the generator with the 'node index.js' command. The answers given to each question are then allocated to their respective section in the README.md file. Once all questions are answered, the README.md file is generated, and the User can scroll the file or skip to specific sections using the Table of Contents.

## How to Contribute
The project will be left open to all contributors. They will be able to pull all code from the Contribution branch, the Develop and Main branch will be blocked to all outside contributors to prevent disruptions to any working code. All commits made to Contribution branch will be screened by me before being merged to Develop branch.

## How to Test the Project
Answer all the questions prompted, the README.md file should update once questions are complete. You can click on the titles of each section on the Table of Contents to be brought to those specific sections. All license badges and links are respective to the choice selected, and the link should take you to the page of that license. the Github profile link should take you straight to my Github profile as well.
